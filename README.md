An app that ranks individuals (or groups) in order and separates them into tiers based on win percentage. You select a sport, see other people in the area that are in the same tier for that sport and challenge them. The teams post the score after the game is over and the records are updated. Your tier is based on the YTD performance but you also will have a lifetime ranking. Possibly separate into age groups or just set 18+ as one and under 18 as another.


## Database Tables Expected to be Needed

* Tiers
* Sports
* Individuals
* Groups(nests)
* Challenge join table
* Records
* Years

## Monetization

* Ads
* Sports Partnerships
* Golf Course Partnerships

## Future Possibilities
